# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
# product = Products.create([{name: "phone"}, {price: 600}, (image_url: "image_url.jpg"}, {description: "An iPhone 11"})])
# product.save
Supplier.create({name: "Dior"}, {email: "help@dior.com"}, {phone_number: "123"})
Supplier.create({name: "Alexander McQueen"}, {email: "help@mcqueen.com"}, {phone_number: "234"})
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
